<b>Sampling from integers.</b> Knuth-Yao and discrete Ziggurat methods.</br>
<b>Basis orthogonalization.</b> Usual Gram-Schmidt procedure and Block-GSO algorithm of (Lyubashevsky and Prest, 2015).</br>
<b>Discrete sampling from lattices.</b> Usual Gaussian sampler, which is quite similiar to Klein's, Klein's and Peikert's methods.</br>
<b>Ongoing.</b> Hybrid sampler of (Ducas and Prest, 2015), and compact sampler of (Lyubashevsky and Prest, 2015) for discrete sampling from lattices.
