This implementation is intended to have three main C++ classes: HIBE, OT, and PKE-PEKS. Different from (Chen, and Lin, 2014), we replace the HIBE system of (Agrawal, Boneh, and Boyen, 2010) by the HIBE construction of (Mochetti, and Dahab, 2014) using ideal lattices in order to reduce the public key size.
</p>

<p>
So far, we are considering only the HIBE class, which has four main algorithms: SetUp, KeyDerive, Encrypt, and Decrypt. The SetUp algorithm is already able to generate the system master keys, e.g. two basis for an orthogonal lattice, and it uses the IdealTrapGen algorithm (Stehl√© et al., 2009).

<p>
In focus, we have the KeyDerive algorithm that requires samples from a discrete gaussian distribution and from lattices. This project includes the constant-time implementation of both Ziggurat (Buchmann et al., 2014) and Knuth-Yao (Roy, Vercauteren, and Verbauwhede, 2013) sampling algorithms. The Gaussian sampler from ideal lattices will follow the approaches of (Lyubashevsky, and Prest, 2015).
